After a successful 2023 conference and a much needed break, itâ€™s time to start getting the process moving on organising the 2024 conference.

Organising a conference the size of DDD Perth takes a large number of people to volunteer, and the first step in putting together another awesome conference is to form the committee that will steer us through everything 2024 has to offer.

The AGM will be held on the** 30th January 2024 **at **17:30**, if you are interested in attending then please reach out to us via e-mail at _info_ (at) _dddperth.com_
