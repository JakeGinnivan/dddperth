DDD Perth is an inclusive non-profit conference for the Perth software community. Our goal is to create an approachable event that appeals to the whole community, especially people that don't normally get to attend or speak at conferences. We do this by:

-   Making the ticket price as low as possible ({props.conference.ticketPrice})
-   Running the event on a Saturday
-   Allowing anyone to submit about any software industry-related topic
-   Having a democratically chosen agenda
-   Focussing on creating a safe and inclusive environment where everyone is welcome

Furthermore, DDD Perth aims to both create opportunities for underrepresented minorities, juniors, and first-time speakers to present, as well as influence the wider software industry to encourage such opportunities more broadly.

## What do we do with the money we raise?

DDD Perth is run by DDD WA Inc., a non-profit association. All funds raised as part of running DDD Perth, selling merchandise on [Red Bubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/dddperth), or any other activities are used for:

-   Running current, or future, DDD Perth or DDD By Night events
-   Sponsoring events or meetup groups in the WA software industry that align with the purpose and goals of DDD Perth
-   Other activities that contribute to the WA software industry and align with our purpose and goals

## What does DDD stand for?

DDD Perth started as part of the Developer! Developer! Developer! series of events. While our heritage is as a developer-focused conference, DDD Perth is not just for developers but for all professionals in the software industry. These days we don't expand DDD - it's not an acronym for us anymore, but if people insist, then we might say Designer, Developer, and Data Scientist, or is it DevOps, Data architect, distributed tester?

DDD was set up with a number of key elements in mind, which hold true for all DDD conferences held worldwide:

-   It is free/low cost
-   It is on a Saturday
-   An open submissions process
-   A democratically chosen agenda
