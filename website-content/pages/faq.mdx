        <summary>How much does it cost to attend?</summary>
        <p>
            The ticket price covers your entry, food, and coffee all day! After-party tickets are purchased separately. We
            are able to keep the ticket price low thanks to our generous sponsors. The event is a non-profit, and any excess
            will be kept for future events or donated to charity.
        </p>

    <details>
        <summary>What if I can't afford to attend?</summary>
        <p>
            If you can't afford the ticket price, we have Sponsored (Financial Assistance) tickets available. We also have
            an option for people to donate further tickets. The only requirement for eligibility is that you can't afford
            the ticket.

        <summary>How do after party tickets work?</summary>
        <p>
            After-party tickets are only available as an upgrade when purchasing a conference ticket. If you can't attend
            the conference but still want to attend the After Party, purchase a pay-it-forward or remote conference ticket,
            and you are eligible to purchase an After Party ticket.
