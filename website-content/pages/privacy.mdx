DDD WA Inc. is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information.

We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The APPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure, and dispose of your Personal Information.

A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at [www.oaic.gov.au](https://www.oaic.gov.au).

## What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?

Personal Information is information that identifies an individual. In the course of your visits to our website or use of our products and services, we may obtain the following information about you: name, company name, email address, telephone number, credit card details, billing address, dietary requirements, current job, current industry, current seniority, geographic location, IP address, survey responses, support queries, blog comments, and social media handles (together ‘Personal Information’).

We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, including: communicating with you, providing technical support, notifying you of updates and offers, sharing useful content, measuring customer satisfaction, diagnosing problems, and providing you with a personalized website or conference experience.

We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in aggregated and anonymized forms to improve our services, including: administering our website, producing reports and analytics, advertising our products and services, identifying user demands, and assisting in meeting customer needs generally.

## How is this information collected?

Personal Information is collected when you register to attend a DDD WA Inc. event, submit a talk proposal to DDD Perth, vote on talks you’d like to see at DDD Perth, apply for a DDD WA Inc. competition/program, or subscribe to our email newsletter via this website.

## Third Parties

Your Personal Information is accessible only by DDD WA Inc. members and volunteers, and we will respect and protect your privacy as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy – and do not and will not sell your personal data.

DDD WA Inc. shares your personal data with third parties only with your express consent or under another lawful basis for processing. We share your data with vendors such as host and cloud service providers, marketing and mailing agencies, for the purposes of improving our communications with you.

DDD WA Inc. relies on certain third-party services as part of our service offering to you. These third-party services operate under their own privacy policies which you should review, understand, and consent to separately from this policy. This policy does not endorse nor incorporate policies maintained by third-party services.

All payments are processed by third parties such as Tito and Stripe. DDD WA Inc. does not have access or visibility to credit card numbers and these are not stored by DDD WA Inc.

## Links to Other Websites

This website may contain links to other websites. These links are meant for your convenience only. Links to third-party websites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval of these websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware, when they leave our website, to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this website.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances including the following:

-   Third parties where you consent to the use or disclosure; and
-   Where required or authorized by law.

If there is a change of control in our organization (whether by merger, sale, transfer of assets, or otherwise), customer information, which may include your Personal Data, could be transferred to a purchaser under a confidentiality agreement. We would only disclose your Personal Data in good faith and where required by any of the above circumstances.

**2024 Update:** For our 10-year anniversary, we will be compiling Personal Information from the 10 years of DDD Perth to elevate the experience for multi-year sponsors and attendees through named callouts and references throughout the event. Should you wish to not be recognized in this way, please contact us via our Privacy Policy Complaints and Enquiries process.

## Security of Personal Information

Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse, loss, and unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.

When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information. However, most of the Personal Information is or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a minimum of 7 years.

## Access to your Personal Information

You may access the Personal Information we hold about you and update and/or correct it, subject to certain exceptions. If you wish to access your Personal Information, please contact us in writing at [info@dddperth.com](mailto:info@dddperth.com).

DDD WA Inc. will not charge any fee for your access request but may charge an administrative fee for providing a copy of your Personal Information.

In order to protect your Personal Information, we may require identification from you before releasing the requested information.

## Maintaining the Quality of your Personal Information

It is important to us that your Personal Information is up to date. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If you find that the information we have is not up to date or is inaccurate, please advise us as soon as practicable at [info@dddperth.com](mailto:info@dddperth.com) so we can update our records and continue to provide quality services to you.
