DDD Perth is an inclusive non-profit conference for the Perth software community, providing a unique opportunity to sponsors because we attract people that don't normally go to software conferences. This occurs as a natural result of our core principles:

- Making the ticket price as low as possible; people don't need to request PD budget from their employer to attend, and it's accessible to most people regardless of financial circumstance.
- Running the event on a Saturday; people don't have to arrange time off work, and contractors don't have to miss out on billable opportunities.
- Allowing anyone to submit about any software industry-related topic; gathers wide interest from extended networks within the community.
- Having a democratically influenced agenda; generates excitement and interest from the wider community.
- Focusing on creating a safe and inclusive environment where everyone is welcome; encourages a diverse set of attendees and attracts repeat visitors, expanding the event's presence year on year via a growing network.

DDD Perth is a not-for-profit community event with a low ticket price for attendees (much lower than the per-person cost), and the only way we can run it is via generous corporate sponsorship. Thanks to all our sponsors, new and old - we can't do this without you!

We have a sponsorship prospectus that will be provided on request that explains the detailed benefits and impact of sponsorship and the differences between the various levels. If you would like a copy, [please contact us](mailto:sponsorship@dddperth.com)!
