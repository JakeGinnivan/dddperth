        <summary>👷🏾‍♀️ Logistics</summary>
        <p>
            Logistics team members curate the attendee experience, from admission right through to catering. The team is responsible for our attendee experience — the conference layout from check-in to sponsors to room layouts, what food to provide and how best to do it, and how best to include any extra like childcare or quiet room. If you want to level up childcare, the food, coffee, signage, even the venue itself, this team is the right place. This team is a busy, on the ground team, responsible for making the conference come alive.

        <summary>💼 Sponsorship</summary>
        <p>
            Looking after our sponsors is such an important part of the conference, as we simply couldn't go forth without their generous help. This team is responsible for onboarding, as well as coordinating the nitty gritty to get us to conference day.

        <summary>👩🏻‍🏫 Conference Content</summary>
        <p>The Conference Content team is responsible for finding and coordinating our keynotes, brainstorming the content outline for the conference, and looking after our wonderful speakers. From mentoring first time speakers to booking flights for our keynotes, this is a team that curates the speaker experience. Think our conference should have a workshop track? This is the team for you.</p>

        <summary>👩🏼‍🏫 On the day Crew</summary>
        <p>This conference takes a village to organise, and this team is responsible for ensuring the day runs as smoothly as possible. Its an early start, and a huge effort to ensure everything is bumped in fully before attendees can start checking in. Tasks will include registration desk, event marshalling, helpdesk, & a raft of ad hoc things on the day.</p>

        <summary>📸 Photography</summary>
        <p>We like to take as many high quality photos as possible to record all aspects of the conference, and this requires a squadron of experienced photographers to be constantly snapping away both in the rooms and hallway spaces. If you are an experienced photographer with your own equipment, please express your interest to work with this team.</p>

        <summary>🚪 Room Co-coordinator</summary>
        <p>Each of our speaker tracks takes place in their own room. Each one has a dedicated room coordinator to ensure each track starts, runs and finishes according to the schedule. You will also need to introduce the speaker and facilitate Q&A should this be factored into their talk as well as ensure they have everything they need & solve for any unexpected surprises that may occur throughout to keep on track. You will need to be very confident speaking in front of large audiences & able to think on your feet, so if you have previous experience speaking at conferences yourself in the past, that would be a huge benefit for this role!</p>
