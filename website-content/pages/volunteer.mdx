        <p>
            Logistics team members curate the attendee experience, from admission right through to catering. The team is
            responsible for our attendee experience — the conference layout from check-in to sponsors to room layouts, what
            food to provide and how best to do it, and how best to include any extra like childcare or quiet room. If you
            want to level up childcare, the food, coffee, signage, even the venue itself, this team is the right place. This
            team is a busy, on the ground team, responsible for making the conference come alive.

            Looking after our sponsors is such an important part of the conference, as we simply couldn't go forth without
            their generous help. This team is responsible for onboarding, as well as coordinating the nitty gritty to get us
            to conference day.
